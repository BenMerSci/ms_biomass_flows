            Trophic interactions make the backbone of ecological
            communities. From herbivory to predation, these interactions
            of varying strength shape ecosystem and their related
            functions. There is a pressing need to be able to predict
            interaction strength at the scale of whole communities.
            While functional responses focus at the pairwise interaction
            level, we question here if the same underlying mechanisms
            could be leveraged to make predictions at the scale of the
            community. In this study, we develop 4 hierarchical models
            of increasing complexity based on the type I and the type II
            functional responses to predict biomass fluxes between
            consumers and resources at the community level. The main
            objective is to determine if simple mechanism such as mass
            action (type I) and the saturation of fluxes (type II) are
            sufficient to predict biomass fluxes. To do so, we collected
            19 Ecopath networks encompassing 1380 interactions across
            marine, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. While we can not
            reject the mechanism of saturating fluxes (type II), our
            results suggest that a mass action mechanism is sufficient
            and more robust, in the context of our data, to predict
            biomass fluxes between consumers and resources at the
            community level. We also recovered the expected allometric
            relationships between consumers body mass and their space
            clearance rate parameters within the mass action model,
            further solidifying our findings. Further modelisation is
            needed, specifically a trait-matching model with more data,
            to develop a model generalizable to more taxons and types of
            trophic interactions.

            qualitative, i.e.Â they are meant to predict if there is an
            interaction or not, and there is a pressing need to expand
            them to quantitative interactions, where the strength of
            interaction between any two organisms is described.</p>
            <p>There are many definitions of interaction strength <span

            <em>et al.</em> 2004)</span>, and among them biomass flows
            can be particularly suited for the development of predictive
            models. Biomass flows between consumers and resources can be
            derived from functional traits, with the promise of a

            class="citation" data-cites="Berlow2004IntStr">(Berlow
            <em>et al.</em> 2004)</span>. Quantitative predictive models
            of biomass flows might also offer potential support to the
            study of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
            relationship, as it seeks to depict all energy flows within

            Interaction strengths between consumers and resources is

            data-cites="Rall2012UniTem">(Rall <em>et al.</em>
            2012)</span>. Functional response theory aims at describing
            the change in feeding rate of a consumer, or how many prey
            or resource a consumer can predate per unit area over time,
            relative to prey or resource availability <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Holling1959ChaSim Holling1959ComPrea Solomon1949NatCon">(Holling
            1959a, b; Solomon 1949)</span>. Where the functional
            response describes the actual number of individual prey or
            resource predated by a consumer per unit area over time,
            biomass flows describes the amount of biomass flowing from a
            prey or resource to a consumer per unit area over time.
            Since both quantities report the rate of the same underlying
            process that is predation, we anchored the development of
            our modeling approach in functional response theory.</p>
            <p>A fundamental principle underlying the majority of
            functional responses is the mass action, stating that
            predator and prey move randomly in an area and encounter at
            a rate proportional to the product of their abundance and
            their velocity. Here we will focus on the two most commonly
            used types of functional responses. The type I functional
            response describes mass action only, where the amount of
            resource consumed depends on the resource and consumer
            densities, and the rate (formerly reffered to as attack rate
            and hereafter space clearance rate <span class="citation"
            data-cites="DeLong2021PreEco">(DeLong 2021)</span>) at which
            a consumer searches its home range for resources, leading to
            random encounters followed by detection, attack and
            consumption. The type II functional response describes the
            same process as the type I, but with the addition that
            consumption saturates with prey availability because of the

            searching for preys from above or fishes grazing the benthic
            surface are examples of 2D planes while aerial insectivorous
            birds pursuing flying insects or fishes chasing preys in the

            theory therefore makes a good start to develop predictive
            models of quantitative interactions since widely measured

            <p>Our main objective is to test if we could model
            quantitative interactions in complex food webs with easily
            accessible information such as abundance and body mass. We
            compared statistical models derived from functional response

            investigate if allometric relationships between space
            clearance rate, handling time and consumer body mass can
            contribute to the prediction of biomass flows in diverse
            food webs. To do so, we developed four hierarchical models
            of pairwise quantitative interactions of increasing
            complexity and evaluated them with empirical data of biomass
            flows between consumers and resources. We curated Ecopath

            is a modelling software that relies on a mass-balance
            premiss and a multitude of parameters (production/biomass
            ratio, consumption/biomass ratio, diet compositions etc.) to

            reduces biases in comparative analyses among food webs

            highly variable and it is not uncommon that species are
            lumped into functional groups. The models were therefore
            selected based on the taxonomic resolution with the criteria
            that most nodes must be resolved at the species level, or
            that species within functional groups were taxonomically
            resolved. We thus curated 19 Ecopath models (detailed list
            in supplementary material) from aquatic, marine and
            terrestrial environments (fig.Â 1), and trophic guilds
            spanning from mammal carnivores and herbivores, birds,

            0.835 (model 3). The model ranking based on the predictive
            accuracy with LOO, where higher values are better, revealed
            that the best performing model is the single species
            saturating model (model 3) with an ELPD score of -2452.8,
            almost equal to the multi species saturating model (model 4)
            and the consumer specific mass action model (model 2) with
            ELPD scores of -2713.5 and -2749.4 respectively. The the
            null model (model 0) and the general mass action model
            (model 1) followed with ELPD score of -3529.1 and -4056.1,
            respectively. Model ranking reveals that, with the exception
            of model 4, every hypothesis that is added to the model
            contribute significantly to ELPD and <span
            class="math inline">R<sup>2</sup></span>. The most
            significant increases is observed between model 1 and model
            2, indicating that, once we account for mass action (model
            1), the most important element is predator specific
            consumption rate (model 2). Adding saturation only marginaly
            improves the fit (model 3), while accounting for
            multi-species saturation has no significant impact (model
            4).<br />
            It is to be noted that both model 3 and model 4 had higher
            Pareto K diagnostic values (&gt; 0.7), which might indicate
            non-robust model or highly influential observations <span

            <p>Model ranking based on ELPD with LOO. Models are ranked
            from best to worst based on their predictive accuracy with
            the LOO package. {#tbl:table_ranking}</p>
            <p>Model comparison suggests that mass action only catches
            most of the variability in biomass fluxes, but the graphical
            representation of predicted biomass flows against observed
            biomass flows reveals a very significant bias that is solved
            with species-specific space clearance rates (figure fig.Â 2).
            Since the bias in predictions disappears in all three
            species-specific models and that model 1 ranked below our
            null model, it was dismissed. Model ranking and the RÂ²
            suggest the single species saturating model (model 3) is
            better than model 2 and 4, but the difference is hardly
            significant both from statistics (Table
            tbl.Â <strong>Â¿tbl:table_ranking?</strong>) and graphical
            representation (figure fig.Â 2). The consumer specific mass
            action model (model 2) and the multi-species saturating
            model (model 4) are the closest together regarding their
            ELPD score. Furthermore, the added multi-species aspect of
            model 4, relative to the single-species model 3, does not
            improve the fit, neither from statistics nor from graphical
            representation, therefore dismissing model 4. The
            <em>extreme</em> Pareto K values of model 3 and 4 would also
            suggest that both models might not be suited to make
            prediction as is <span class="citation"

            <p>At first glance based on the model ranking and the RÂ²,
            the single species saturating model (model 3) seems to have
            better predection accuracy than model 2 and 4. The
            prediction against observations plots is hinting at the same
            conclusion, where all three models look pretty similar but
            the points in model 3 are more grouped around the diagonal
            line. The consumer specific mass action model (model 2) and
            the multi-species saturating model (model 4) are the closest
            together regarding their ELPD score. Since model 3 and model
            4 are both based on the type II functional response, showing
            barely no difference in fit and model 3 ranking better, we
            dismissed model 4. This decision is also based on parsimony,
            the extreme Pareto K values and model 2 having a higher RÂ²
            than model 4. Posterior distributions of the space clearance
            rate (figure fig.Â 3) are very similar across the three
            models, with the distinction that the distribution of model
            3 and 4 were wider while model 2 were narrower. Handling
            time also varies significantly between species (figure
            fig.Â 4), with some species having very wide distributions
            and without clear differences between trophic guilds.</p>

            <p>We lastly investigated the relationships between space
            clearance rate, handling time and body mass. We found a
            significant relationship between body masses and the space
            clearance rate for the specific mass action model (model 2,
            figure {fig.Â 5}.A). Relationship with the space clearance
            rate and consumers body mass was significant with a slope of
            0.98 (p-value &lt; 0.05, adjusted RÂ² of 0.56). This
            relationship was not significant however for space clearance
            rates extracted from model 3 (model 3, figure fig.Â 5 .B and

            <p>The motivation of this study was to develop predictive
            models of quantitative interactions for entire food webs.
            There are already several techniques to predict the
            occurrence of interactions and to reconstruct binary
            interaction networks such as the niche model <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Williams2000SimRul">(Williams

            data-cites="Pichler2020MacLea">(Pichler <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span>. There are also quite a few meta-analyses of
            functional responses, none of them can be applied to entire
            food webs as they were mostly based on single species
            analyses. Here we developed these one step further with the
            prediction of biomass flows as a function of mass action,
            allometric scaling and the full web composition. To do so,
            we investigated an ensemble of models to predict biomass
            flows between populations of consumers and resources
            inspired from functional response theory. Four mechanistic
            model of increasing complexity based on the type I and the
            type II functional response were compared to test different
            hypotheses. In contrast with functional response studies,
            where the variation of consumption rates of consumers with
            resource density is evaluated, here we attempted to predict
            biomass fluxes between all pair of species within a
            community context. Upon initial inspection of the fits of
            each model, it appears that models based upon functional
            response type I (mass action model) and type II (saturating
            model) are well suited to predict biomass fluxes. We discuss
            hereafter the inherent propreties of each model and compare
            them regarding their predictive capabilities of biomass
            fluxes. Specifically, we compared the different underlying
            mechanisms and discuss whether mass action is enough or if
            the incorporation of saturation with consumers handling time
            is an important addition to predict biomass flows. We follow
            by exploring whether the expected allometric relationships
            with both parameters of interest (space clearance rate and
            handling time) are observed. We conclude by addressing the
            limitations of the study and potentiel next avenues for
            improving the model.</p>
            <p>Overall, based on the Baysian RÂ², the model ranking
            (table tbl.Â <strong>Â¿tbl:table_ranking?</strong>) and their
            graphical representation, we found that all the models
            (except the null model) had a good fit. While model 1 looks
            like a good one by looking at the performance metrics, it
            had a discernable and clear bias in terms of data fitting
            which undoubtedly arose from the non-specific space
            clearance rate. Model 1 portrayed a mass action process
            where consumption rates simply follows encounters between
            consumers searching their environment for resources based on
            a rate at which they clear space <span class="citation"

            vary with species body mass and other traits <span

            variety of organisms ranging from small fish to terrestrial
            mammals. The improvement in fit of model 2 in contrast to
            model 1 further consolidate this hypothesis, where the
            implementation of a consumer-specific space clearance rate
            greatly improved model fitting and resulting RÂ², thus
            dismissing model 1. With this said, model 2, 3 and 4 all had
            similar outcomes regarding RÂ² and predictive accuracy (table
            tbl.Â <strong>Â¿tbl:table_ranking?</strong>), while portraying
            different ecological mechanisms. While model 2 implemented a
            mass action process with consumer-specific space clearance
            rates, model 3 and 4 incorporated a second mechanism of
            saturating biomass fluxes with consumers handling time. Both
            models 3 and 4 were based upon a type II functional
            response, where the main difference was that model 3 was

            (single-species) while model 4 was accounting for the
            biomass of all prey species available in the community
            (multi-species). While we expect consumers consumption rates
            over a resource to vary depending on the availability of all
            its resources of interest <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Smout2010FunRes">(Smout <em>et al.</em>
            2010)</span>, the multi-species saturating model
            underperformed compared to the single-species saturating
            model. Accounting for all resource biomass did not seem to
            improve the fit, thus dismissing model 4. Given the great
            diffrence in number of parameters between model 2 and 3
            (table <span class="citation"

            their similar fit, and the high Pareto K values of model 3,
            model 2 seems to be the most parcimonious choice.
            Additionally, there seems to be a tradeoff between the space
            clearance rate and handling time parameter which introduces
            variability in the estimation of space clearance rate
            (figure fig.Â 3). This tradeoff also seems to impact the
            expected allometric relationships of space clearance rate
            and handling time with consumers body mass in model 3
            (figure fig.Â 5 -B-C). Even though model 3 had the highest RÂ²
            and ELPD score, it may also suffer from misspecification as
            indicated by the high Pareto K values <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Vehtari2017PraBay">(Vehtari <em>et al.</em>

            relevent and can not totally be dismissed from our analysis,
            it seems that a simple model such as our consumer-specific
            mass action model gives a satisfying approximation of
            biomass fluxes.</p>

            <p>The form of the functional response has been the subject

            on a different scale than single species functional response
            studies, taking advantage of the wide variability of feeding
            rates among species of different population sizes in a full
            community, instead of focusing on pairwise interactions with
            experimental manipulation of a single resource density. We
            nonetheless expected to observe similar functional responses
            and associated parameters since both approach describe the
            same underlying processes. Larger organisms are expected to
            have larger space clearance rate, whereas handling time
            might vary with consumers and resource body mass [<span

            Consistent with the anticipated relationship, largest space
            clearance rate in model 2 are related to larger organisms
            such as large and medium mammal predators, predatory birds
            and sharks, while lower space clearance rate are related to
            smaller organisms such as invertebrates, shrimps and small
            pelagic fish omnivores (figure fig.Â 3). The space clearance
            rate in model 3 mostly displays the same relationship with
            consumers body mass while having larger flat distributions
            (figure fig.Â 3). The allometric relationship with handling
            time is however less precise, where higher or lower handling
            time are not specifically related to larger or smaller
            organisms (figure fig.Â 3) Based on field observations and
            modeling, handling time would not be as important in
            consumptions as resource individuals needed to saturate a
            consumerâ€™s consumption rates could rarely be observed in
            natural context [<span class="citation"

            the poor unobserved body mass relationship of our handling
            time parameter, it might lend additional support for model
            2. Overall, the inter-consumer distribution of the space
            clearance rate parameter for model 2 and 3 fall well within
            the range values reported in other studies [<span

            estimates of the slope of this relationship however varies
            significantly between studies, with values that are usually
            much smaller than 1 <span class="citation"

            We found an estimated slope of 0.98 on the log-scale (figure
            fig.Â 5 -A), with a relatively narrow confidence interval,
            suggesting a linear relationship between consumer body mass
            and the space clearance rate, which is coherent with a
            certain portion of the relationship developed by <span

            model 2 seem to display the expected relationship between
            space clearance rate and consumers body mass (figure fig.Â 5
            -A), we can clearly discern some species having an upward
            offset. The consumers of concern here are all terrestrial
            carnivores or omnivores belonging to the Arctic networks
            originating from the same set of study. As Ecopath compute
            estimates over a year step <span class="citation"

            and the data from the Arctic networks were seasonally
            assessed for summer observations, we can not overlook that
            this offset might arise from a methodological bias.
            Alternatively, the higher space clearance rate of these
            terrestrial species might also arise from other impacting
            factors such as interaction dimensionality and habitat
            heterogeneity <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Pawar2012DimCon">(Pawar <em>et al.</em>
            2012)</span>. We also note that the allometric relationship
            disappears with the single-species saturating model (figure
            fig.Â 5 -B-C). We believe this may happen because of a ridge
            in the likelihood space consequent to a tradeoff between
            space clearance rate and handling time, making the model
            non-identifiable. Perhaps this problem could be solved with
            stronger priors, for instance using parameters found in

            variety of available methods allow some flexibility,
            depending on the objective of the study and data
            availability. They are however all limited to binary
            interactions, i.e.Â if a pair of species are interacting or
            not. Quantitative information on the strength of interaction
            is required to move to a next stage of interpretation, just
            like abundance is a more accurate description of community
            structure than presence-absence. We successfully predicted
            biomass fluxes with a very limited amount of information
            which suggests that, paired with a method to predict binary
            interactions, the reconstruction of quantitative interaction
            networks is accessible. Our model analysis was inspired by
            theory, and despite a different methodological approach, our
            results are in agreement with previous meta-analyses of
            functional responses <span class="citation"

            strenghtening the confidence in our models. We found also
            coherence in parameter estimates across ecosystems and
            feeding guilds, suggesting that a general approach is within
            reach. Nonetheless, although our models were built upon the
            best available data at the time, it should not be overlook
            that our results strongly depend on Ecopath model outputs,
            and thus their limitations. As such, the interpretation of
            our results should reflect this reality. The obvious next
            step will be to catch some of the residual variance, likely
            with the addition of other traits. Inspired by the methods
            used for binary interactions, the next model generation will
            have to account for trait-matching between consumer and
            ressource. Interactions could also be made conditional on
